Use this directory to add any headers and sources that you want to be built
as part of CommonMod static library.
For example:
- Headers shared between targets (if you have more than one)
- Public interface headers

This directory is added to the public include path of CommonMod (and by dependency, ExampleMod).
Please, make a subdirectory for your mod instead of putting files into the root.
